## 🔹 Part 1: Prompt Practice for Non-Native English Speakers

### 🎯 **Core Objectives**
- **Prompt writing is a learnable skill**, especially important for non-native speakers facing language challenges.
- **Start simple, increase complexity gradually** — helps build confidence and clarity in prompt design.
- **Clarity, context, and tone** are critical elements that improve prompt quality and LLM responses.
- **Avoiding idioms and complex grammar** enhances understanding and reduces misinterpretation.

### 🛠️ **Key Techniques & Their Importance**

| **Technique**                  | **Explanation & Importance** |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| ✅ **Simple, Direct Prompts** | Avoiding overcomplicated language helps non-native speakers communicate clearly with the model. |
| 🧒 **Specifying Audience** | Adapting complexity for the reader ensures better-targeted answers (e.g., for children). |
| 🧾 **Providing Examples** | Helps guide the LLM’s response format; supports clarity in expectations. |
| 📨 **Setting the Tone** | Ensures tone appropriateness (formal/informal), essential in professional or cultural contexts. |
| 🎭 **Assigning Roles** | Adds context, increasing relevance and depth of responses (e.g., teacher, analyst). |
| ⚖️ **Avoiding Bias** | Encourages inclusive and ethical language, critical in global or diverse contexts. |
| 🧠 **Step-by-Step Thinking** | Breaks complex problems into understandable steps; fosters logical learning. |
| ✍️ **Using Output Primers** | Provides starting structure (e.g., a sentence or format), guiding creative or technical output. |
| 📚 **Requesting Detailed Responses** | Ensures thorough answers when depth is needed. |
| ✏️ **Correcting Language Errors** | Builds awareness of prompt clarity and grammatical precision. |
| 🔍 **Prompt Comparisons** | Shows how slight changes can significantly improve clarity and specificity. |

### 📘 **Why This Matters**
These strategies empower **non-native speakers** to overcome language barriers, reduce ambiguity, and build the skills necessary for **high-quality communication with LLMs**, which is foundational for further AI-related tasks.

## 🔹 Part 2: Prompt Practice for Agentic AI Developers

### 🎯 **Core Objectives**
- **Agentic AI** systems require prompts that trigger **reasoning, tool-use, and autonomy**.
- Prompts should be optimized across **five core performance factors**:
  1. **Reasoning ability**
  2. **Tool-calling proficiency**
  3. **Accuracy**
  4. **Cost efficiency**
  5. **Structured output**
  6. *(+ Context size management)*

### 🛠️ **Key Techniques & Their Relevance**

| **Technique**                    | **Explanation & Importance** |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 🧠 **Step-by-Step Reasoning** | Guides the agent’s logic and reduces hallucinations. |
| 🔧 **Tool-Calling Specification** | Explicitly instructing which tools to use enhances reliability and reduces ambiguity. |
| 📊 **Structured Output** | Tables, JSON, bullet points improve clarity and usability of results. |
| 💬 **Concise Tone Management** | Reduces cost and keeps answers readable and focused. |
| 🧑‍💼 **Role Assignment** | Boosts reasoning relevance by giving the agent domain-specific context (e.g., data analyst). |
| 🧾 **Context & Token Management** | Reduces costs and increases performance by avoiding bloated inputs. |
| 🪄 **Output Primers** | Directs output formatting (e.g., JSON) to improve accuracy and consistency. |
| 📉 **Avoiding Overcomplication** | Helps with scalability and avoids unnecessary agent workload. |
| 🔍 **Prompt Corrections & Comparisons** | Trains developers to improve clarity, structure, and efficiency in real-world scenarios. |

### 📘 **Why This Matters**
These techniques teach developers how to **precisely guide autonomous agents** in using tools, analyzing data, or completing tasks with minimal cost and maximal effectiveness — crucial for **real-world applications like automation, analytics, and customer support**.
